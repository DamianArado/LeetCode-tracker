/*
Initialize a vector called remaining, which contains the needed
matching numbers of each character in s.
If there are still
characters needed to be contained (increment i in this case),
decrease the matching number of that character and check if it is
still non-negative. If it is, then it is the character in t, so
decrease the total required number required.
If there is no more
characters required (increment start in this case), record min
and left if a smaller length is found. Recover the number of this
character in the remaining and if it is a character in t
increase required.
